The navbar has links to the interesting stuff on this site.

Since you're here though, you should take some steps to increase your security online a little bit!

## Basic Security Quick Wins

Here are some quick wins:

- disable JS by default in your browser (whitelist the sites you use a lot)
- use a password manager, but make sure you have a strong master password. Anything more than 15 characters should be good. You could even use this: [easyphase passphrase generator](/utils/easyphrase/)
- install an adblocker in your browser
- enable multi-factor authentication on your accounts
- install [EFF's Privacy Badger][badger] to block tracking
- install [EFF's HTTPS Everywhere][ever] to force encryption
- use a vpn on networks you don't own

Even if you do one of these things, you will be a little more secure than when you started.
