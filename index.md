## Basic Security Quick Wins

I think this is an important topic.

These are some quick wins for the average user's threat model.

- disable JS by default in your browser (whitelist the sites you use a lot)
- use a password manager, but make sure you have a strong master password. Anything more than 15 characters should be good. You could even use this: [easyphrase passphrase generator](/utils/easyphrase/)
- enable multi-factor authentication on your accounts
- install [EFF's Privacy Badger][badger] to block tracking
- install [EFF's HTTPS Everywhere][ever] to force encryption
- use a vpn on networks you don't own
- install an adblocker in your browser
