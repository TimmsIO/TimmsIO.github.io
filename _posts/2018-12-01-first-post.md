# First Post!!

There really isn't much here though.

Maybe check out [manyheads](/projects/manyheads), an active aid to subdomain enumeration tools.
I wrote the tool during an external attack surface audit in which I enumerated *7000 subdomains*.

Using the rough-version of manyheads I confirmed 3 subdomain takeovers, and a host [ðŸ™„] of other issues in a relatively short amount of time.

Since then, I've cleaned it up (a little) and added functionality.
Although it uses HEAD by default, now you can give it any valid HTTP Method to use.
I also added a 'human-readble' and JSON format options to the existing 'greppable' output, as well as the ability to save each result to a separate file.

This is **NOT** a stealthy tool, and it does actively engage the target.
Unless you have permission to audit, don't use this tool!

Here is a sample of the 'human readable' output to give an idea of what it does:
