# Useful Tools

This is a curated list of all the tools and websites I have found useful in my daily exploits as an operational security officer.

## CyberChef

[CyberChef][cc]

CyberChef is a collection of useful tools for data processing and analysis written by GCHQ for people in infosec. Has a million and one uses!

## Cesnsys

[censys.io][censys]

Censys.io is similar to shodan, but has search functionality I have found useful for becoming one with the threat-surface. It give a very quick picture of the security posture of an organisation once you come to terms with the search interface.

## Malwr.com

[malwr.com][mal]

Malwr.com is great for quickly getting reports from a Cuckoo Sandbox analysis of malware files. It is an easy way to get some quick answers for phishing email payloads.

## DNS Dumpster

[DNS Dumpster][dns]

DNS Dumpster is a great tool for OSINT around a domain. It retrieves all the DNS records associated with the domain, and creates a tree of the DNS relationships between the IP addresses associated with the domain.

Useful tool for meetings.

## TailBlazer

[TailBlazer][tb]

While amazing for log files, it is also great for opening big text files. I once needed to open a 600MB .csv and this made that easy. You can get it from RolandPheasant's GitHub page, linked above.

## Tmux Cheatsheet
[Tmux Cheatsheet][tmxcs]

I use Tmux at home and at work, but I don't always remember the hotkeys. This website solves that.
